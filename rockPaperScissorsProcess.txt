Objective:
This program will allow the user to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer
-We will create code that checks who won each round 
-Create code that takes the input(choices) from the user
-Create code that takes input from the computer
-Check if the user wants to quit OR if the user doesn't enter one of the options.
-loop each round of the game
-add statements at the end and beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
-loop the whole game, so that they can keep playing until they choose to quit


Pseudocode:
#set variable keepPlaying to true
#While keepPlaying is true:

    #print statement welcoming players to the game
    #print statement stating the rules (best 2 out of 3. Press 'q' to quit)
    
    #make a key that assigns a number to each choice for the computer
    #(rock is 1, scissors is 2, paper is 3)
    
    #import the random function - the computer makes its choice randomly from this function
    
    #set computer's score to 0
    #set player's score to 0
    
    #while player's score is less than 2 and computer's score is less than 2:
    
        #computer's choice = random number between 1 and 3 (random function gets used here)
        #player's choice = input(ask player to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors)
        
        #start checking user options
        #userChoice = userChoice.lower()
        #if players inputs 'q':
            #set keepPlaying to False
            #stop the loop
        
        #else if (player inputs rock and computer chooses rock) or
        #(player inputs paper and computer chooses paper) or 
        #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses scissors):
            #print out DRAW
            #print out player's score and computer's score
            
        #else if (player inputs rock and computer scissors) or
        #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses paper) or
        #(player inputs papers and computer chooses rock):
            #add one to the player's score
            #print out player's score and computer's score
            
        #else if (player inputs rock and computer paper) or
        #(player inputs scissors and computer rock) or
        #(player inputs paper and computer scissors):
            #add onne to the computer's score
            #print out player's score and computer's score
        
        #else:
            #tell the user their input was invalid
            
    #print statement tanking the players for playing
    #if player's score is 2:
        #print statement letting the player know they won
    #if computer's score is 2:
        #print statement letting player know that the computer won
    #print out the player's score and computer's score
